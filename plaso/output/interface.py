"""This file contains the interface for output parsing of plaso.

The default output or storage mechanism of Plaso is not in a human
readable format. There needs to be a way to define the output in such
a way.

After the timeline is collected and stored another tool can read, filter,
sort and process the output inside the storage, and send each processed
entry to an output formatter that takes care of parsing the output into
a human readable format for easy human consumption/analysis.
