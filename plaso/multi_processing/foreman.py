  The Foreman is responsible for monitoring worker processes

  * the number of events extracted by each worker;
  * the path specification of the current file entry the worker is processing;
  * an indicator whether the worker is alive or not;
  * the memory consumption of the worker.

  This information is gathered using both RPC calls to the worker
